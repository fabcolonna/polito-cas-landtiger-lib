## What's this?

This is a sample project for the ARM-based LPC1768 board, developed in Keil uVision 5. It is a simple project that uses the custom C interface for peripherals developed in the `lib` folder, already imported as a Source Group in the
.uvprojx file.

## Status

This library is currently under development. These are the peripherals that will eventually be supported:

- [X] Buttons

- [X] RIT & Debouncer
- [X] SYSTick
- [X] Power Management
- [X] LEDs
- [ ] Sound System & MIDI Interface
